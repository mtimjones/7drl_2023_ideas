# BorgRL Game Design Document

This documents the design for the 2023 7DRL.

BorgRL is a Borg Roguelike.  The player is the Borg and travels across N sectors, fighting enemies, scavanging resources, mining planets and converting these resources into upgrades for its evolving fleet of assimilated drones.

## Features
- Procedurally generated sectors
- Turn-based and real-time gameplay (user can pause)
- Permadeath

## Development Plan

[ ] Experiment with drone balancing.
[ ] Reuse prior 7drl map UI.
